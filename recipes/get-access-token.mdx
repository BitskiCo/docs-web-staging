title: Get an Access Token
description: Get an access token to use with other API calls.
---

## 1. Configure your application

Get a set of Backend Credentials, a `client id` and `client secret`, from your [Developer Portal](https://developer.bitski.com/).

```python
# Get a Client ID and a Client Secret from your Developer Portal at
# developer.bitski.com.
CLIENT_ID = ""
CLIENT_SECRET = ""
```

## 2. Set the scopes

Set the grant to `client_credentials` and the scope to `eth_sign`.

```python
def get_access_token(client_id, client_secret):
    """Get an access token."""

    response = requests.post(
        "https://account.bitski.com/oauth2/token",
        data={
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "scope": ["eth_sign"],
        },
        auth=(client_id, client_secret),
    )
    print("Token granted successfully:", response.status_code == 200)
    return response
```

## 3. Authenticate with your credentials

Use HTTP Basic Authentication to send your credentials. See `auth=` from above example.

```python
auth=(client_id, client_secret)
```
## 4. Get your token

The call should return a 200 and the access token should be in the `access_token` field in the response. The above print statement would output the following.

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "access_token": "",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "scope": "eth_sign",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```
