title: Deploy an NFT contract
description: Deploy a previously created NFT contract.

## 1. Configure your contract

Set your auth token, app ID, and contract ID.

```python
# Get an auth token using your Developer Portal credentials.
AUTH_TOKEN = ""
# Your application id is also in the Developer Portal.
APP_ID = ""
# Get your contract id from a previously created contract.
CONTRACT_ID = ""
```

## 2. Set the contract type

Set the `deploymentState` to PENDING_PROXY.

```
body = {"contract": {"deploymentState": "PENDING_PROXY"}}
```

3. Deploy the contract

Send a PATCH request to the API with the auth token in the body, and app ID and contract ID in the URL. You should receive a 200 status code if it worked.

```python
def deploy_contract(auth_token, app_id, contract_id):
    """Deploy an NFT contract."""

    body = {"contract": {"deploymentState": "PENDING_PROXY"}}
    response = requests.patch(
        f"https://api.bitski.com/v1/apps/{app_id}/contracts/{contract_id}",
        json=body,
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {auth_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
    )
    print("Deployed NFT contract successfully", response.status_code == 200)
    return response
```

## 4. Verify the contract is deployed

It will take at least a few minutes to deploy, but once done it will show up in your [Creator Portal](https://creator.bitski.com/) under the "Collections" tab and be marked as "DEPLOYED".

```python
response = deploy_contract(AUTH_TOKEN, APP_ID, CONTRACT_ID)
print(f"response:\n{response.json()}")
```
