### What's the difference between _Collection_ and _Contract_?

Collections and contracts are synonymous to each other. The contract refers to
your smart contract that’s been deployed on the blockchain and allows your
collection to be created. A smart contract is not a legal document but rather a
software program with predetermined conditions. A smart contract makes it easy
for anyone buying your NFT to trace it back to the original creator of that NFT.

Once you deploy the smart contract, your collection is activated. This allows
you to then create and sell your NFT.

### What is a smart contract to a creator and which type is right for me?

When you're setting up a Creator account, you'll have the option to choose
between two types of Smart Contracts – Shared and Custom. Both contract types
have benefits. Read below for more information on which is right for you.

#### Shared contract

Shared contracts give you the freedom to start selling NFTs with no money down.
This is a major bonus when you're first starting out! If you choose a shared
contract, please note that you **will not** receive royalties from any secondary
sales. Also, secondary sales will populate under the contract name "Bitski"
instead of your name. You can still choose the name of your Storefront when
onboarding to Bitski’s Creator Portal.

If you start out with a shared contract and change your mind down the road, you
can opt to deploy your own contract at any time.

#### Deploy your own contract

Deploying your own contract allows you to receive royalties from secondary sales
of your NFTs because you are the sole owner of your contract. You can deploy
your own contract for a one-time fee of $25\. This fee is to cover the gas price
of deploying the contract onto the blockchain.  
\*Please note that you will receive 10% royalty from any secondary sales. The
10% cannot be changed even if you import from OpenSea.

Users can also add a new collection directly through the creator portal. Visit
the collections tab on the portal, and click + New. Add in your new custom
contract name, pay the one time $25 fee and you’re set!

### What's a contract?

A smart contract is a piece of code, usually written in
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org). It gets deployed onto the blockchain and
can then be interacted with by users or other smart contracts. Once deployed
on-chain, a contract's code **cannot** be modified.

A smart contract is needed to create and verify ownership of NFTs. Each contract
has a function that can mint an NFT onto the blockchain as well as show the
current owner of a given NFT.

### What type of contract does Bitski use?

Bitski smart contracts are based on the
[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) specification.

### How do I find my contract address?

You can find your smart contract address through the creator portal. Go into
“Collections” on the left tab and select the deployed collection you would like
get the address to. After clicking on that collection, there will be a contract
address in the top right shown that you can click to copy.

### How do I become an admin on my contract in OpenSea?

Once an NFT is minted from your contract, it can be shown in OpenSea as a
collection. You will need to be an admin on your contract in order to change:

- the collection description
- the collection profile image and background
- the payout address for the royalties

To become an admin on your contract OpenSea needs to link your Bitski wallet
address to the contract. To do so, make sure you have the following items with
you:

- Your ETH wallet address
- Your contract address (See “how do I find my contract address”)

Once you have these details at hand, reach out through this website
[here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500004957562-How-can-I-contact-OpenSea-)
to get in contact with the OpenSea team with your admin request.

<Note>
  Until an NFT has been purchased through Bitski on your collection, it won't
  show up on OpenSea.
