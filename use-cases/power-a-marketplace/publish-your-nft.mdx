#### How do I publish an NFT on Bitski?

To publish or schedule your NFT on Bitski takes just four simple steps:

1. Log in via [creator.bitski.com](https://creator.bitski.com)
2. Click "+ New" on the Creator Portal. Bitski displays a menu.
3. Fill out the listing with:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Properties (Key + Value) for metadata
   - Add Primary Media
   - Unlockable Content (Optional)
   - Include Snap Lens (Optional)
   - Include an Instagram Filter (Optional)
   - Include Any Additional Files (Optional)
   - Sales Details
4. Make sure under "Sales Details" that you specify the correct date & time you
   want:
   - For products to go live immediately, hit “Publish”
   - For products to go live at a future date and time, adjust the launch time
     then hit “Schedule”

For a visual representation, the top of the menu will look something like this:

## Sales Types

### Auctions

1. Description: Auctions are 1-1 NFTs. A time limit is set, and the winner of
   the NFT goes to the highest bidder.
2. Additional Details:
   - Sniper Safe: There is a 5 minute extension on bids if they're made within
     the last 5 minutes.
   - This means there is no winning bidder unless no one bids against them for
     the last 5 minutes. If they do, the timer adds an additional 5 minutes.
     This helps to _safe guard against last minute snipers who try to place a
     small incremental bid right before the timer runs out._

- Minimum Bids: We added another layer to make any live auction even more sniper
  safe. Check out the chart below for more details!

| Starting Bid | Minimum Bid Increments |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| $100         | $5                     |
| $101 - $250  | $10                    |
| $251 - $500  | $25                    |
| $501 - $1000 | $50                    |
| $1001 - $10k | $100                   |
| $10k +       | $250                   |

- Suggested Pricing: Since auctions offer NFTs that are the most rare, this tier
  usually merits the highest level of pricing relative to your consumers'
  household income levels

### Limited Editions (aka fixed price listings)

1. Description: Limited editions are based off of a fixed quantity of available
   NFTs. The sale will run for an infinite amount of time until all quantities
   are sold out (i.e. 20 editions only)
2. Suggested Pricing: Generally limited editions should not be priced too high.
   While there is scarcity due to the limited quantity, these NFTs are not
   one-of-ones. We recommend testing out lower pricing before moving forward
   with higher-tier pricing for future sales, as it's better to sell-out than
   not. There is a minimum sale price of $0.50 USD for Limited edition sales.
   Anything lower should give an error when the product is created within the
   CMS.
3. Please note that you can change the price of an NFT that has not minted yet,
   but if 1 or more of your NFT has sold, then the price should not be able to
   be updated.
