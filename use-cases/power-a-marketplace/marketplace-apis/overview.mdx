Ethereum blockchain."

All you need is an [auth token](/reference/authentication) to use these APIs and
be able to create contracts and mint NFTs.

There are three main areas of Blockchain APIs:

- Contracts
- Token Templates
- Tokens

## [Contracts](/reference/contracts)

Here you can create, update, and view contracts associated with your account.
Bitski assigns each contract a UUID which you will need to use with other
endpoints to create templates and NFTs.

## [Token Templates](/reference/token-templates)

Token templates are assigned to a contract by the contract's UUID. Each template
can be used to mint **one or more** NFTs. Bitski uses ERC 1155 contracts, so you
can have multiple templates associated with a contract, and multiple NFTs per
template. There is no limit to the number of templates or NFTs you can create
per contract.

A template holds default metadata for common attributes that are applied to each
NFT minted from the template. Things such as the name, description, and image
url can be set.

Once you create a template Bitski assigns it a UUID, which you will need to use
in order to mint an NFT or update the metadata.

## [Tokens](/reference/tokens)

You can view your tokens and their metadata, as well as mint new tokens, with
these APIs. You'll need a template id and a contract id, as described
previously, to use these.
