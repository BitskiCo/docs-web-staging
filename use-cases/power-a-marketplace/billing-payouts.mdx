#### Add your billing information

Prior to publishing your first product, make sure that you’ve connected your
bank account and place a credit card on file for the one-time collection fee.
(See “What is a collection fee” for more details.) We request a bank account on
file so we can pay you out for any sales accrued from your NFTs. Payouts are
distributed via Stripe, our payment gateway, in 48-hour cycles, or up to 14
days, depending on your region.

If you didn’t add a bank account during the onboarding flow, you can add this
now by clicking “Billing” on the left menu of your creator portal. Add your bank
account details in the “Payments” section.

<Warning>
  Please note that while you set up your Stripe account within the Bitski
  Creator Portal, please select the right region. Otherwise you will need to
  start over with a new Stripe account with a different email and correct
  region.
</Warning>

#### What is the collection fee?

Your "collection" is synonymous with your contract name. With Bitski, your
collection remains solely under your name. When your NFT is resold on a
secondary marketplace like OpenSea, your NFT will appear under your collection
name.

As we develop our own secondary marketplace, our friends at OpenSea will act as
your default secondary marketplace. Once you mint your first NFT, you will get
your very own OpenSea collection automatically made as well! If you want to use
other marketplaces, you can connect your Bitski wallet using the Walletconnect
feature on iOS to try sites like Looksrare, X2Y2, Blur, and more!
