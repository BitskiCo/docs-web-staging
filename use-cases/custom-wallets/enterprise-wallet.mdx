## Creating an Enterprise Wallet

To create an enterprise wallet, you first need an app. Start by visiting our
[Developer Portal](https://developer.bitski.com/), then click _New App_ and
enter your details.

After you create your app, you can then create your Enterprise Wallet:

1. Go to the developer portal.
2. Navigate to your app details.
3. Select the **Accounts** tab.
4. Click _New Account_ to generate an ethereum account.

You will then see your account's address and current balance across our
supported networks.

## Create your credentials

You will need to create credentials in order to actually use your Enterprise
Wallet in your code. These credentials are exchanged with our OAuth server for
an access token, which is then used to access your accounts.

To create a credential, go to the developer portal, then to your app details
page. Next, select the **Backend Credentials** tab, and click _New Credential_.

Bitski will display your credential id and client secret in a modal. Make sure
to download the credentials or copy these down somewhere, as the secret _cannot_
be retrieved later. If you lose the secret, you will have to regenerate it on
this screen.

Currently, each credential can access all of the accounts under your app. We
recommend creating one credential per app or service that uses it. That way you
can remove access as needed with as little interruption as possible.

Important: Since these credentials allow you to send transactions from your
enterprise wallet without any prompt, you should treat them as a username and
password. Be careful not to share them with any untrusted parties.

## Fund your Enterprise Wallet

This is currently a manual process. We recommend buying ETH from a third-party
such as [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) and sending it to your enterprise
wallet's address.

## Signing Rules

For additional security, we allow you to create rules around what transactions
should be signed. These rules are specific to each individual address for
additional flexibility. You can find these settings in the **Accounts** tab
under your app. Click _Edit_ on the account you want to set rules for.

## Restrict To Addresses

This rule allows you to lock your Enterprise Wallet to only sign transactions
where the recipient matches the list. When enabled, Bitski will check
transactions for their "to" field and will only approve transactions that match.
This is a good feature to enable for use cases where your account is only used
to execute calls on a particular contract.

## Backend SDKs

We currently have SDKs for both Node.js and Python applications. These SDKs take
your credentials and give you a web3 provider that is ready to use. If you would
like to use Enterprise Wallet on another platform, please contact us and we will
consider creating an SDK for it.

- Python SDK

## Deploy Contracts with Truffle

We also have a simple Truffle plugin that makes deploying contracts from your
Enterprise Wallet easy. Read more about it
[here](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-truffle-provider).

### Get an Access Token

Use your credential id and secret to request an access token using OAuth. Most
platforms have a library that can handle this step for you. Your token has a
relatively short lifespan, so you should store the expiration date and request a
new one when it expires. You must request the scope `eth_sign` in order to sign
transactions,
