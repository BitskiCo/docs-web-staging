title: "JSON RPC Support"
---

With your access token and an Ethereum address, you can start sending
transactions. You can use any Web3 client to send these transactions as we
support all the standard Web3 JSON-RPC methods.

```json
POST /v1/web3/mainnet HTTP/2
Host: https://api.bitski.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR ACCESS TOKEN
X-API-Key: YOUR CLIENT ID

{
  "id": 1
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_sendTransaction",
  "params": [{
    "from": "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155",
    "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
    "gas": "0x76c0",
    "gasPrice": "0x9184e72a000",
    "value": "0x9184e72a",
    "data": "0x0"
  }]
}
```

You can also sign transactions (you will need to send them yourself via
`eth_sendRawTransaction`) for any EVM chain by replacing `/web3/mainnet` with
`/web3/chains/{chain_id}`

```json
POST /v1/web3/chains/13337 HTTP/2
Host: https://api.bitski.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR ACCESS TOKEN
X-API-Key: YOUR CLIENT ID

{
  "id": 1
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_signTransaction",
  "params": [{
    "from": "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155",
    "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
    "gas": "0x76c0",
    "gasPrice": "0x9184e72a000",
    "value": "0x9184e72a",
    "data": "0x0"
  }]
}
```

Bitski will sign a transaction if:

- Your token is valid
- This account is funded, and
- The transaction is valid.

Transactions you submit via this API must include all fields with the exception
of nonce.

<Note>
**Need more RPC?**

For a list of all the supported methods, see
[Ethereum's JSON-RPC spec](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/).
