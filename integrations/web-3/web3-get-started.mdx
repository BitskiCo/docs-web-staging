We primarily support the following EVM based networks for JSON-RPC calls. These
networks will have the best performance in our system.

| Name             | Chain Id | URL                                    |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ethereum mainnet | 1        | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/1       |
| Ethereum Goerli  | 5        | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/5       |
| Polygon mainnet  | 137      | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/137     |
| Polygon Mumbai   | 80001    | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/80001   |
| Optimism         | 10       | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/10      |
| Arbitrum One     | 42161    | https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/42161   |

Additionally, any EVM chain on https://chainlist.org/ should work but will be
using publicly hosted RPC nodes. Simply replace the chain id in the RPC url:
`https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/chains/{chain_id}`.

### Unsupported Networks

Rinkeby and Kovan Ethereum testnets are no longer supported and RPC calls will
fail.
