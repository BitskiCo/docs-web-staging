### CoinDesk
CoinDesk utilized the Bitski SDK and APIs to build a simple Web3 wallet experience for their users and enable the collection of DESK tokens from interacting with the site. 
Today, not only can users accrue DESK from reading articles, watching videos, and participating in the CoinDesk ecosystem; they also can easily transfer or spend their DESK tokens for various perks.

### Centaurify
Centaurify is powering the Web3 experience for Universal Music Group (UMG). Discover, collect, experience and connect with your favorite artists. Music 3.0 is here. To easily add Bitski and onboard
users, Centaurify leveraged our custom RainbowKit connector to plug-and-play with their existing list of wallets. Not only can existing Web3 users log in via our browser extension or iOS app, but
an entire wave of non-crypto natives can also onboard via a familiar username and password flow.
