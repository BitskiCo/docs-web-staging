title: "SDK Overview"
---

To get the most out of Bitski's JavaScript SDK, you need to be familiar with configuring OAuth2 login flows, and have a DApp that's ready to go. You can learn more about OAuth2 at the official site. Bitski's JavaScript SDK makes it easy to connect your DApp to users, wallets, and the Ethereum or Polygon blockchains. Both mainnet and testnets are supported (Rinkeby and Mumbai on Ethereum and Polygon, respectively). You can roll your own callback page, or use Bitski's static callback.html file.
