title: "Sending Transactions Overview"

<Warning>
  One of the main differences with using Bitski's wallet in your app over
  Metamask or other wallet providers is in the Send Transaction flow.
</Warning>

## How it works

When you submit a Transaction via `sendTransaction(...)`, our SDK picks up the
transaction and shows an approval dialog to the user. (Note that we host this
approval dialog on our Bitski website for security.) The user can then review
the details of the transaction and either approve it or reject it.

On the web, we show the dialog as a modal over your web app. On iOS, this
happens in a Safari modal that displays over the native app.

If the user approves the transaction, Bitski will sign the transaction, submit
it to the network, and return the transaction hash just like any other wallet.
If the user declines the transaction, we will return an error.

## Optional fields

Bitski does not require you to submit all fields of a transaction in order to
process a transaction. The following fields are optional:

| Name     | Default                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| nonce    | Bitski will calculate the next nonce for you.                            |
| gasPrice | Bitski will calculate a gas price for you based on the current averages. |

## Gas

We believe that most of you don't want to have to think about gas and gas
prices. They are confusing terms and concepts. Instead, in our transaction
approval screen, we display gas as a transaction fee. Which is essentially what
gas is. (Note that we don't currently offer the ability to customize it.) This
creates an experience that is more familiar to most people and makes your app
more appealing.
