At Bitski, we believe digital experiences will power the future of commerce and economic activity. Today, the early exploration of 
these experiences are driven by cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - all summed up by the term, Web3. 

However, just like m.site.com began the mobile revolution and transitioned to a point where everyone now has a handheld phone loaded with apps like TikTok, Instagram, and Youtube -
so too will Web3 undergo a mass consumer shift as the world continues to gravitate online. We envision this world to be simple and easy to understand, unlike today's need to know 
about smart contracts, blockchain networks, and the like. 

To drive this vision, we created an unparalleled wallet experience a la the Bitski Vault to kickstart the transition from Web3 today to the Internet of tomorrow.

Here’s what sets our wallet apart:

- **Simple + Secure User Wallet:** We secure all user wallets in special
  hardware devices called Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). These are physically
  protected in biometric-secure data centers that are regionally distributed
  across the US (Asia & Europe coming soon). Bitski is the only company that
  offers a hardware-backed wallet that users and developers can access anywhere,
  anytime. (We even hire white-hat hackers to find any potential security risks
  so we're constantly upping our security game!)
- **Ease of integration:** In addition to the usual 'Connect Your Wallet' option, 
  we offer a single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth compliant wallet that can easily integrate 
  into games, social platforms and more so your NFTs can live outside of your wallet. 
  This provides users a well-known experience of logging in with a username,
  password, or passkey common across many of today's websites. A Bitski wallet also
  plugs and plays with existing decentralized apps (Dapps) like OpenSea.
- **Never Worry about Lost Keys:** Bitski's keys never leave the hardware, so
  there's always a way to safely recover wallets for users. This means no seed
  phrases to remember! That's right, you don't have to dig through a landfill in case you
  accidentally toss out a physical key! Lastly, remember "Not your keys,
  not your crypto?" While we store your private keys, we can verifiably prove we do not 
  have access to them at any time. This means you can have the reassurance of a self-custody
  wallet without having to manage the risks on your own! No one else in the 
  industry offers this capability today.
