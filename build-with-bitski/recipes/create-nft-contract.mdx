title: Create an NFT contract
description: Create a contract that can mint NFTs.
---

## 1. Configure your application

Set your [auth token](/build-with-bitski/authentication) and your application id.

```python
# Get an auth token using your Developer Portal credentials.
AUTH_TOKEN = ""
# Your application id is also in the Developer Portal.
APP_ID = ""
```

## 2. Configure your contract settings

Set the contract details:

- network is a required field
- all the others are optional, see [Create a contract](/use-cases/power-a-marketplace/marketplace-apis/create-a-contract) reference for more detail.

The `deployFrom` field defaults to an internal Bitski address.

```python
# Configure the NFT's metadata
CONTRACT = {
    "contract": {
        "network": "rinkeby",
        "name": "Bitski Contract Recipe",
        "symbol": "BCR",
        "description": "Bitski Contract Recipe",
        "externalLink": "",
        "contractType": "SEMI_FUNGIBLE",
    }
}
```

## 3. Create the contract

Send a POST request to the API with the authentication token and contract payload in the request body. You should receive a 200 status code if it worked.

```python
def create_contract(auth_token, app_id, contract):
    """Create a NFT contract."""

    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.bitski.com/v1/apps/{app_id}/contracts",
        json=contract,
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {auth_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
    )
    print("Created NFT contract successfully", response.status_code == 200)
    return response
```

## 4. Remember your contract id

After creating the contract, you will need to use the returned id to mint an NFT. It will be returned in the `contract.id` field of the JSON response.

```python
response = create_contract(AUTH_TOKEN, APP_ID, CONTRACT)
contract_id = response.json()["contract"]["id"]
print(f"contract id is: {contract_id}")
```

```json Response
{
  "contract": {
    "id": "12345678-da5b-494c-8719-bdba105e3612",
    "deploymentState": "DRAFT",
    "address": null,
    "network": "rinkeby",
    "name": "Bitski Contract Recipe",
    "description": "Bitski Contract Recipe",
    "externalLink": null,
    "contractType": "SEMI_FUNGIBLE",
    "tokenTemplates": []
  }
}
```
