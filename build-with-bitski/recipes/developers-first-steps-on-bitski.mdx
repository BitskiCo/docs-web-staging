title: "Deploy a smart contract and mint an NFT"
---

If you just want to mint an NFT, and sell it under the Bitski shared or
individual contract on the Bitski Marketplace, head over to the
[Creator Portal](https://creator.bitski.com). If you're creating your own
NFT-focused dApp, using the APIs, you're in the right place. This guide works in
conjunction with the recipes available on the Bitski docs site. A link to each
recipe can be found in the corresponding section. In writing this guide, Python
3.10.2 was used. Verify that you have the `requests` library installed for
Python 3.10 before getting started. If you’re unsure, run the following shell
command:

```bash Shell
pip3 install requests
```

<Warning>
  The APIs used in this guide are restricted, and need elevated access
  credentials. Send an e-mail to support@bitski.com containing your app ID and
  credentials client ID, or reach out in the #developers channel of the [Bitski
  Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZjKur6tTDC) if you'd like to use them.
</Warning>

Each section in this guide (beginning with “Getting an access token”) is
performed as an API request. Upon success, a response is returned that contains
information necessary for the next step. There are a few of these pieces of
information that you’ll need to keep track of throughout this guide (and working
with the blockchain in general). They are:

| Variable          | Description                                                                                                              | Source                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app ID            | Your application's ID                                                                                                    | Found (labeled as “Client ID”) in the Overview section of your app's Info page in the Developer Portal. |
| auth token        | Grants access to the Bitski APIs. Expires after about 6 hours.                                                           | Contained in a response to a successful API request.                                                    |
| client ID         | Your client ID, used for obtaining an auth token.                                                                        | Contained in the downloaded credentials JSON file.                                                      |
| client secret     | Your client secret, used for obtaining an auth token.                                                                    | Contained in the downloaded credentials JSON file.                                                      |
| contract ID       | The ID of the contract used to mint your tokens.                                                                         | Contained in a response to a successful API request.                                                    |
| token template ID | The ID of the token template used to mint your tokens. Token templates are also called “products” in the Creator Portal. | Contained in a response to a successful API request.                                                    |

If you lose track of your token template ID, you can go to its page in the
[Creator Portal](https://creator.bitski.com) and look at the URL. It contains
your app and token template IDs in the following format:

```
https://creator.bitski.com/app/[APP ID]/products/[TOKEN TEMPLATE ID]/edit
```

### API Request Response Codes

Whether or not your API request is successful, the response will carry a code. A
successful request response carries a code beginning with 2 (200 or 201). If
using the `requests` library with Python, the output from `json.response()` will
contain additional information.

Here are some of the error codes you may encounter, what they mean, and how you
can resolve them.

Response codes 401 and 403 represent an authentication error. Early in the
process, this likely means that your app ID and client ID have not yet been
authenticated. If you're seeing either of these when attempting to deploy a
contract or mint a token, make sure that you have billing set up in your
account.

Any other response code that starts with a 4 will likely mean an incorrect
request was sent. Common scenarios include forgetting or misspelling a query
parameter, which will result in a 404.

Response codes beginning with a 5 represent a server error. In these instances,
check with support either via support@bitski.com or on the Bitski Discord
server.

If you attempt to mint a token and are told that something has gone wrong, make
sure that the contract under which you're attempting to mint is on the Ethereum
mainnet. Currently, contracts on Rinkeby cannot mint tokens (though you can
begin the process of token template creation via script).

### Creating your app

1. Sign into the [Developer Portal](https://developer.bitski.com), and click the
   New App button in the upper right corner.
   ![168](/assets/images/e172a85-image11.png)
1. Name your app. Optionally, enter the URL for your app’s homepage, and assign
   it to an organization (if applicable). Click Create app.
   ![516](/assets/images/d5d3dd0-image9.png)
1. Click the Bitski icon in the upper left to return to your list of apps.
   ![189](/assets/images/0fc6ce2-image3.png)
1. Click on your app’s name. In the Overview section, you’ll find your app’s ID
   (labeled “Client ID”). Copy this, as you’ll need it later in this guide.
   ![1113](/assets/images/e81a9a8-image2.png)

### Credentials

You’ll need backend credentials to get an auth token to sign transactions.

1. Still on your app’s page in the Developer Portal, click Credentials in the
   left column.
   ![222](/assets/images/90db8a9-image6.png)
1. Click New Credential in the upper right.
   ![1108](/assets/images/a3192b9-image8.png)
1. A popup appears with your newly created credentials. At the bottom, click
   Download Credentials to receive a JSON file containing your Client ID and
   Secret. This popup is the only chance you’ll have to access your client
   secret. _It’s important that you download the file or record your client
   details before closing the window_. If you miss it, you can generate a new
   secret.
   ![460](/assets/images/dd89ec1-image13.png)
1. You’re ready to get authenticated, so that you can request an access token.

### Authentication

Also known as an auth token (not to be confused with a Non-Fungible Token), this
grants access to Bitski’s APIs. Each lasts for about 6 hours before a new one
needs to be generated due to security requirements.

### Getting an access token

1. Launch your Python IDE and create a new script.
2. Copy the code from the access token recipe below into your Python IDE.

<Card title="Get an Access Token" icon="key" href="/build-with-bitski/recipes/get-access-token">
  Open Recipe
</Card>

1. Copy the client ID and secret from your credentials JSON file to the
   corresponding variables CLIENT_ID (line 5 in the recipe code) and
   CLIENT_SECRET (line 6) in your Python script.

In the JSON file:

```json credentials.json
`{ "client": { "id": "[my client id]", "secret": "[my client secret]" } } `
```

In your Python script:

```py Python
`CLIENT_ID = "[my client id]" CLIENT_SECRET = "[my client secret]" `
```

1. Save and run your script. If successful, you should get a response like the
   following. The token has been removed here, but it’s a long string consisting
   of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, underscores and periods.

```
Token granted successfully: True access token: [removed]
```

1. Copy this token, as you’ll need it in the next step.

### Set up your contract

### Configure your contract

Once you have your auth token and app ID, you're ready to create your contract
to mint your NFTs. It’s important to note that creating a contract does not
automatically deploy it. While you’re still learning, or when testing something
new, it is recommended to use the Rinkeby testnet – which does not incur any
charges, but does not allow actual minting of NFTs, and is set by default in the
recipe code – rather than the live mainnet.

1. In your Python IDE, create a new script.
2. Open the recipe below and copy the code to your IDE.

<Card title="Create an NFT contract" icon="file-signature" href="/build-with-bitski/recipes/create-nft-contract">
  Open Recipe
</Card>

1. As before, populate the variables with your copied data.

- **AUTH_TOKEN** (line 4) - your auth token from the previous section. If it’s
  been more than about 6 hours since you generated it, you’ll need to generate a
  new one before continuing.
- **APP_ID** (line 6) - your app ID. See the Overview section of your app’s Info
  page in the Developer Portal if you did not copy this earlier.

1. On line 11 of the recipe code, the contract is set to use the Rinkeby
   testnet. If you’re creating an actual contract, you’ll want to change rinkeby
   to mainnet.
2. Save and run your script.
3. Similar to when the auth token was generated, your contract ID will be shown
   upon success.

```
contract id is: 12345678-da5b-494c-8719-bdba105e3612
```

### Deploy your contract

Before you can mint an NFT, you'll need to deploy your contract. To do this,
you'll send a PATCH request to same endpoint as the previous step when you
created the contract. Even if creating a free/test contract, you’ll need to have
billing set up in order for the server to find your “store” (your online
presence that grants you the ability to deploy contracts).

<Warning>
Deployment costs money

If you deploy a contract to mainnet we charge $250 to cover the gas fees
required to deploy it.

</Warning>

1. Open the recipe below, and copy the code into a new script in your IDE.

<Card title="Deploy an NFT contract" icon="rocket" href="/build-with-bitski/recipes/deploy-nft-contract">
  Open Recipe
</Card>

1. Populate the variable data with your auth token, app ID, and contract ID.
2. Save and run your script.

### Create your NFT

### Configure your NFT

A token template, also known as a NFT, is used to mint tokens. As with the other
steps in this guide, you need an auth token to create a token template.
Additionally, you need to provide the following information:

- **Application ID** This is your application under which your contract and
  products are created.
- **Contract ID** Also known as a collection, a contract is what mints your
  NFTs. You can use an existing contract, or create a new one.
- **Max Tokens** The number of tokens to be minted.
- **Product Name** The name of your token. When minting more than one token, all
  tokens share the name. If you'd like to mint individual single tokens, with
  unique names, you'll need to create multiple token templates.

1. Open the recipe below, and copy the code into a new script in your IDE.

<Card title="Create a Token Template" icon="files" href="/build-with-bitski/recipes/create-token-template">
  Open Recipe
</Card>

1. Populate the variable data with your auth token, app ID, and contract ID.
2. Save and run your script.
3. Note the token template ID.

```
token template id: 4aea50a7-7254-46a3-bbe2-7b54339ff722
```

### Preparing to mint your NFTs

After you've deployed your contract and created your token template, you're
ready to finish preparing your NFT. In the
[Creator Portal](https://creator.bitski.com), token templates are called
products, and contracts are called collections. Before you can mint, you need to
have a title (you created this as part of the token template script, earlier), a
description, and at least an image. You also need to select whether your NFT(s)
will be sold for a fixed price or at auction with a specified minimum bid. At
the time of this writing, it isn’t possible to fully prepare or mint NFTs on a
test contract.

1. Log into the [Creator Portal](https://creator.bitski.com). You should see a
   page similar to the one below.

Token templates are listed as Products, and Contracts under which they’re minted
are listed as Collections.

![1348](/assets/images/37d08a4-image7.png "image7.png")

1. Click on the product you made earlier to enter the Edit Product page.
2. Fill out both fields of the Product Information and add your primary image.
   ![1347](/assets/images/402572c-image5.png "image5.png")
3. Upload any optional additional data.
4. In Sales Details, select your sale type and set the details accordingly.
   ![1035](/assets/images/2074846-image4.png "image4.png")
5. Click “Update” to save your changes.

### Minting your NFT

You’re finally ready to mint! This section assumes you want to mint directly to
a wallet, be it your own or a buyer’s. If you just want to make the NFTs
available for sale or auction, you need only click Schedule under Sales Details.

1. Copy and paste the code from the recipe below into a new script.

<Card title="Create an NFT" icon="hexagon-vertical-nft" href="/build-with-bitski/recipes/create-nft">
  Open Recipe
</Card>

1. As before, populate your variable data.
2. Save and run your script.
3. In addition to the response in the script, you can also check the Inventory
   column for this particular product in the Creator Portal. The first number is
   the count of minted tokens, and the second is the maximum number of this
   product to be minted.

### Next Steps

Congratulations! If you've worked – or even just read – through this entire
guide, you are now familiar with the process of minting NFTs with Bitski. Though
the steps were in separate scripts for the purposes of this tutorial, in
production you would likely want everything in one or two scripts. A good
separation might be one script to get you from auth token to contract
deployment, and another script for minting after your NFT is fully configured in
the Creator Portal. As you grow more familiar with Bitski, you may wish to build
GUI-based tools.
