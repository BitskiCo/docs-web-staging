title: "Pagination"
description: "Pagination helps limit the number of results from an API request."
---

This improves performance, reduces network traffic, and markedly improves user
response to your marketplace. Our APIs support pagination with the **limit** and
**offset** parameters where applicable.

## Parameters

### limit

A restriction on the number of objects to be returned, usually between 1 and
50\. Some of our APIs have a different upper bound, which can be found in their
route specification.

### offset

The number of objects to "skip" in the request. Put another way, it is the
starting point of the responses.

#### examples

- limit: 10, offset: 0 => \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]
- limit: 5, offset: 5 => \[5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]
