title: "Authentication"
---

The Bitski API uses [OAuth](https://oauth.net) to authenticate requests with a
`Bearer` token. Any API requests that require authentication made without this
token will fail.

To authenticate you will use your Developer portal to obtain credentials which
can then be used to generate a token. Once you have an access token, you can
automatically sign transactions from your appâ€™s wallet.

<Note>
  You should create a new credential for _every_ service that needs to sign on
  your behalf.
</Note>

### Obtain an Access Token

To obtain a token:

1. Go to your [Developer Portal](https://developer.bitski.com).
2. Click **Credentials**.
3. Click **New Credential** to generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Refer to the screen shot below to navigate.

<Warning>
**Be careful**

Your credentials can be used to cause **un-reversible** interactions with the
blockchain. Take care to always use them securely.
