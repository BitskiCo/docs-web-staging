title: "Configure App Settings"
---

<Note>
  You can configure your app's settings from the [Developer
  Portal](https://developer.bitski.com/). Here are some of the things you can
  configure, and what they mean.
</Note>

## App Info

This is metadata about your app and gives users more context. While only the
name is required, these details should ideally be provided for the best possible
user experience.

### Name

This is the name we'll use to reference your app in various parts of the Bitski
interface. For example, it appears in the list of connected apps under the
user's account.

### App URL

This is the URL we'll link to when referencing your app in Bitski.

### Contact Email

This should be an email where we can contact you about any issues regarding your
app. It is not currently exposed to users.

### Privacy Policy URL

We will feature this link when asking users if they want to authorize your app.

### Terms URL

We will feature this link when asking users if they want to authorize your app.

## Redirect URLs

These are approved URLs that clients using your client id can ask to be
redirected to. It's important to keep this list as small as possible so
malicious apps cannot pose as you. If a client asks to be redirected to a URL
that is _not_ on this list, they will receive an error.

Note: These redirect urls must match what your client enters _exactly_. It is
case sensitive and every character counts. Common mistakes are entering http
instead of https, or entering just the domain and not the actual path
([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) instead of
http://localhost:3000/callback.

## Approved Scopes

These are the scopes that we have approved you to request access to in your app.
For web apps, generally this is just openid. Native apps need openid and offline
scopes. If you would like access to a scope and it isn't on this list, please
[contact us](mailto:hello@bitski.com).

## Available Scopes

| Name    | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| openid  | Access to the user's unique identifier.                                                                           |
| email   | Gives you access to the user's email address. Contact us to add this to your app.                                 |
