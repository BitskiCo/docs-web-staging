<Accordion title="Which networks do you support?">

Bitski wallet natively supports:

* Ethereum mainnet
* Ethereum Goerli
* Polygon mainnet
* Polygon Mumbai

If you'd like to use low-level RPC calls, we support any EVM chain. See our [Web3](/build-with-bitski/web-3/web3-get-started) docs for more information.
  
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does Bitski charge?">

Bitski is currently free of charge for users. Developers can view our [pricing page](https://www.bitski.com/pricing/) for more information.
  
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are the benefits of Bitski managing key storage for new users?">

Secure key storage is very challenging. One other possible option besides Bitski is a siloed approach. However, this approach, will be inconvenient for your users. Users will have to fund this wallet separately, and can then only manage their assets through your interface.
  
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How should I integrate Bitski into my app?">

A great place to start is to put our [sign in button](https://github.com/bitskico/bitski-js#using-the-bitski-connect-button) wherever you're currently asking people to install Metamask. 

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I already have an app that uses Metamask, can I still use Bitski?">

We designed the Bitski SDK to be compatible with other wallets and dapp browsers, while still providing a great experience for users who don't already have a wallet. Learn more about integrating our JS SDK [here](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How are you storing and managing private keys?">

Our keys are both created and stored on our HSMs (Hardware Security Modules). Approved transactions are passed to the HSM to sign. The keys never leave the hardware.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do you have an Android SDK?">

Not at the moment, but that is definitely on our roadmap!

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How will users fund their wallet?">

Currently for ETH, users can sign into our [web wallet](https://wallet.bitski.com/) and click **Get ETH** to purchase via credit card.

However, if you're working with digital assets, we suggest using a backend with App Wallet to send assets to users directly. This prevents the need for the user to purchase ETH, while allowing them to have decentralized ownership.
