### Create an app

All apps that use Bitski need to be registered in our Developer Portal. We do
this to keep track of permissions a user grants you.

To register: visit our [developer portal](https://developer.bitski.com), then
click _New App_.

Once registered, you can select your new app from the list. You should now be
able to see your client id.

### Configure your client settings

Once you create your app, you'll need to configure the OAuth settings for it.
You can do this from the OAuth tab under your app details page in the developer
portal.

The most important setting here is the redirect url(s). We use this to ensure
that only the domains you approve can get access tokens for your client id.

See Client Settings for more information on all these settings, .

## Bitski APIs

Bitski provides a number of REST APIs for use in your applications and
development.

Use these sections to develop your solution with greater integration and
sophistication.

Our endpoints have predictable URLs and accept JSON-encoded bodies in requests.
They also return JSON responses and standard HTTP response codes.

Note that Bitski private endpoints require auth and are prefixed with an app ID.
Public endpoints do not require authentication. Endpoints that require
authentication will need an **access token** tied to your
[Developer Account](https://developer.bitski.com). Refer to
[Authentication](/build-with-bitski/get-started/authentication) to obtain this token.
