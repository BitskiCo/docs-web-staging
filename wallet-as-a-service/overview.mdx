### Wallet as a Service (WaaS)

Bitski provides a number of REST APIs for use in your applications and
development.

Use these sections to develop your solution with greater integration and
sophistication.

Our endpoints have predictable URLs and accept JSON-encoded bodies in requests.
They also return JSON responses and standard HTTP response codes.

Note that Bitski private endpoints require auth and are prefixed with an app ID.
Public endpoints do not require authentication. Endpoints that require
authentication will need an **access token** tied to your
[Developer Account](https://developer.bitski.com). Refer to
[Authentication](/build-with-bitski/authentication) to obtain this token.
