title: "Errors"
description: "Bitski uses standard HTTP response status and error codes for communicating the
success or failure of a request."
---

The response body may be in JSON or plaintext depending on the status code.

Typically, if you receive a status code in the:

- `2xx` range, it means the request succeeded.
- `4xx` range, there was a problem with your request.
- `5xx` range, an error occurred on the Bitski servers (very rare).

**Example**

`4xx` and `5xx` messages follow a standard error message response:

```json JSON
{
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "status": "Unauthorized",
    "request": "fcb5e92e-1b2e-4e13-9998-48021efd0627",
    "message": "The request could not be authorized"
  }
}
```

**Common error codes**

| 200                | OK            | The request succeeded as expected.                                                                                  |
