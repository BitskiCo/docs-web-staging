### Create Single-Use Links

When creating a single-use link under a Droplink product, it will offer users
the option to specify how many claims it should contain. Once specified, it will
save a .csv file under the Droplink product. This .csv file will contain
n-number of unique links, each with a limit of one claim.

For example, if a user specifies the link should have 50 claims under a
single-use link, then the .csv will have 50 different links and a limit of one
claim per link. This means once a NFT has been claimed, the link will expire and
the option to claim will not be available for use anymore.

### Create Multi-Use Links

Multi-use links work similarly to single-use links and saves a link under a
Droplink product. The difference is that multi-use links are one universal link
with n-number of claims allowed.

For example, if a user specifies the link should have 50 claims under a
multi-use link, then it will generate one unique link with 50 claims. Once the
NFT has been claimed 50 times, it will become inactive. To prevent abuse, a user
can only claim a multi-use link once.
